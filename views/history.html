            Project Salvador aids the people of El Salvador in implementing
            their own vision of justice. We are involved in many projects which
            assist the Salvadoran people. Project Salvador is incorporated in
            the State of Colorado and recognized by the IRS as the 501(c)(3)
            non-profit organization, “Project Salvador Crafts, Inc.”.

            Project Salvador began in 1986 with the efforts of Dominican priest,
            Father Jim Barnett, who worked in the marginalized community of
            22 de Abril in metropolitan San Salvador. Father Jim organized a
            group of young people who made crafts for sale in the United States
            to help generate some income for their families. Since these humble
            beginnings Project Salvador has funded over 200 development and
            material aid projects and has worked with as many as 30 different
            artisan groups helping to market their crafts in the United States.
